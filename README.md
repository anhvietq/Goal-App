# 📢About
Small goals are worth celebrating! 

This app is all about the simplicity where users can use it to write down whatever it is they would like to do throughout the day. Once the activity 
is completed, users can simply delete the item and create new goals if desired. 

The items are listed from the oldest to newest, which can be very convenient for users who has ADHD like me, who tends to forget what I was doing,
or simply don't remember if I've completed my previous goal 😬.
